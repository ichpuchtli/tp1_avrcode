Team Project 1 - Group 12 AVR Code
----------------------------------

The goal of the project was to build an analog clock display with digital components. This project was part of a compulsory course for electrical and software engineers at the University of Queensland. This AVR Code is targeted for an [ATmega48/88/168] [avr] and is responsible for displaying the time across 30 LED's, while also listening to external inputs such as IR receivers and light sensitive components.
